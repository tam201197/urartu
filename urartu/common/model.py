class Model:
    """
    A class for handling model instantiation and operations within a machine learning framework.
    This class uses configuration-driven instantiation and requires implementation of model-specific
    behavior such as property access and generation methods.

    Attributes:
        cfg (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Configuration list that defines parameters for model instantiation.
        _model (Any): Internal model object, initially set to None until instantiated.

    Methods:
        get_model: Static method to instantiate a model using Hydra's utility based on the configuration.
        model: Property that should provide access to the instantiated model object.
        generate: Method to perform generation based on a given input prompt.
